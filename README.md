# The Stitch Marker Assistant

A webservice/ application made with React and Typescript that will assist you in your
knitting and crochet endeavors.

The main feature being multiple row counters with
easy-to-read information, specific to the row you are currently on, for your various
saved projects. Also including links to instructional videos on how to perform various
stitches and maneuvers such as color changes. Type in your patterns once and see
instruction row for row as you hit the “+” button on the counter

## Purpose

I came up with this idea while surfing around for a good knitting/ crochet app on my
phone that would cover all my needs. Patterns, row counters with the actual row on
display, logbook, instructional videos ect. Being one of the easily distracted crowd, I
wished for an app that doesn’t just let me keep track of where I am, but what that row
entails without having the read half the pattern for the -umft time. When I couldn’t find
exactly what I needed, I figured I could build it myself during my degree project.

## Goal

#### Expected outcome in 6 weeks:

Create a login page, personalized storage via LocalStorage(LS) and a database(DB),
develop a row counter with instructions (connected to individual logins and patterns),
create an online database for storing pattern information, page with instructional
videos, editing of existing patterns. An overall cozy, and bright feel to the styling.
Testing of application, e.g. connection to DB. Make it easy to use on both phone and
webpage.

#### Bonus tasks if time allows:

- Tutorial via pop-up
- Multiple fonts and adjustable fonts to help dyslectic users as well as add
  personalization.
- Color picker/ chooser for the row-counter for a personalized feeling.
- Multiple versions of the same pattern for different sizes.
- Shopping list connected to pattern.
- Logbook for keeping personal notes on project.

#### Potential future additions, outside the scope of this project:

- Make patterns shareable/ sellable in the “correct format”.
- Connect to API from Ravelry (major pattern website) for easier access to patterns.
- Look into the possibility of a “self-structuring” rewrite of patterns. That is, take a
  normal pattern and have the computer re-write it into the correct format. It is likely
  nearly impossible as ppl write patterns very differently from one another.
